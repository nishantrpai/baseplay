# Baseplay

Baseplay is a platform for creating and playing games on the Base blockchain.

# Why?

People want to use their onchain assets to build games.

Spinning their own database to provide services like leaderboards, game state in game.

Then spending time to manage auth, security, etc.

With services like coinbase wallet, smart wallets you can manage auth.

The only thing missing is a way to create games, have services like on chain leaderboard, achievements and many more.

The best existing example of such a system is google play games.

No android dev has to build their own leaderboard system.

They can use google play games.

Since the preference in our community is to have everything on chain, having on chain achievements makes more sense.
