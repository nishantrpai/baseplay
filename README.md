# 🎮 Baseplay

🚀 Baseplay is a platform for creating and playing games on the Base blockchain.

# 🤔 Why?

💎 People want to use their onchain assets to build games, but managing databases, auth, and security is time-consuming.

🏆 Baseplay provides on-chain services like leaderboards and achievements, similar to Google Play Games for Android.

⛓️ Our community prefers on-chain solutions, making Baseplay an ideal platform for blockchain gaming.

# 🛠️ How

💻 Use the web app to create your game and deploy a contract to Base.

🏅 Connect to the contract using our library to manage game state, achievements, and leaderboards.

# Blockers/Concerns

1. What if players interact directly with contract, for e.g., setting leaderboard?

# Things to add

7 Oct 2024:
- Get my games in gamefactory
- Get total players for a game
- Get leaderboard on game
- Add link for game, on click it opens game
- Game preview link from ipfs can be added to the contract
- Avoid spam with $8/game submission that way no one can spam the games
